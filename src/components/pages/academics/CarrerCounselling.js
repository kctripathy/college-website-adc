                  </h4>
                <p>
                    Career Counselling is a process that focuses on helping one understand oneâ€™s own self, as well as work trends, so that one can take an informed decision about career and education. Career Counselling helps manage a diverse range of problems such as low concentration levels to poor time management, trust issues with family to non-agreement between parents and children on which career to choose.

                  </h4>
                <p>All of us require career guidance at some point in our life. It helps us get insights about ourselves, our career and what we can do to improve it. Here are a few ways in which career counselling helps us:</p>
                <p className="mg-10 f-17"><strong>Helps Pick The Right Career</strong></p>
                <p>Career Counsellors are experts at assessing your aptitude, personality, interests, and other aspects of you. They use this evaluation to suggest the best career options from all the available and relevant options.</p>
                <p className="mg-10 f-17"><strong>Helps Provide Expert Resources</strong></p>
                <p>Career Counselling provides access to the resources and knowledge that a career expert possesses. This knowledge of Careers, their scope and the paths to pursue them are most important from the point of view of a parent and child, since most of the times, parents or guardians do not have that kind of knowledge.</p>
                <p className="mg-10 f-17"><strong>Helps Gain Confidence And Insight</strong></p>
                <p>Career Counselling helps a counselee understand the hurdles in his/her career path.  This knowledge helps to develop the confidence to overcome these hurdles. It is the duty of a good counsellor to provide such insight and confidence to the counselee.</p>
                <p className="mg-10 f-17"><strong>Helps Change Unwanted Behavior Patterns</strong></p>
                <p>Students and professionals have habits that are hard to break, such as procrastinating, not keeping updated on latest developments in their chosen career paths, neglecting emotional and mental health, not trying to self-motivate, etc. A Career Counsellor helps break such behavioral patterns that lead to unproductive activities, both at home and in school/college/work.</p>
                <p className="mg-10 f-17"><strong>Helps Remove Career-Related Frustration</strong></p>
                <p>Choosing a career can be a demanding task for both parents and children. A lack of any source of venting out emotions and thoughts may add to the existing frustration. Career Counselling provides a platform where such frustrations can be reduced, and focus is re-directed to selecting the best career options.</p>
                <p className="mg-10 f-17"><strong>Provides A Role-Model</strong></p>
                <p>Career Counselling helps students connect to experts who have enough life experiences to share. They are role models who have accomplished much, and helped people in their life. This is why Career Counselling can serve as an inspiration to those who require it.</p>
                <p className="mg-10 f-17"><strong>Helps Bring Stability In Thought</strong></p>
                <p>Career Counsellors can help you remain calm when it comes to taking a career decision. Counselling helps bring about focus, and maintain that focus throughout in our activities.  Through proper scheduling and planning, they try and make your life more organized.</p>
